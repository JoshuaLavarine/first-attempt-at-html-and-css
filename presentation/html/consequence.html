	<h2>
		I know what you are thinking: <em>"Isn't this supposed to be about something he's passionate about?	Why is he sharing a picture of his family?"</em>

		Jeff
	</h3>
	<p>My older brother, Jeffery a.k.a "Jeff", taught me how to</p> 	<ul>
			<li>play with GI Joe's,</li>
			<li>use cheat codes in video games, and</li>
			<li>download music from Kazaa.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>He is also responsible for the cutest nephew in the world, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lvev6o677ravypy/alex.jpg?raw=1">Alex</a>.</p>

		Dad
	</h3>
	<p>My Dad, John Lavarine III, saved me from a lifetime of being called "Baby John" by opting out of the traditional first name of "John". More imporantly, he taught me</p>
		<ul>
			<li>manners,</li>
			<li>how to throw and catch a baseball, and</li>
			<li>to always chase my dreams.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="parent2">
	<h3 class="underlineCenter">
		Mom
	</h3>
	<p>
		My Mom, Gerry Yenni Lavarine, always called me her "Oreo Cream Filling" because I was the middle child. My mom
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>passed her easy going temperment on to me,</li>
			<li>always brought me my favorite candy (candied orange slices) from work, and</li>
			<li>taught me to pray.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="brother2">
	<h3 class="underlineCenter">
		Jacob
	</h3>
	<p>
		My little brother, Jacob, will always be my little brother (even though he is 21 now and the same height as me). Jacob
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>was the first person to look up to me,</li>
			<li>has always brought a smile to my face, and</li>
			<li>will never be better than me at Baseball Simulator 1.000 for the SNES.</li>
